                <p>If you’re using wood skewers, make sure you soak them in water for 20-30 minutes before threading the chicken on and baking.</p>

            <div class="step-card">
                <p>When using parchment paper, mine usually gets a bit brittle around the edges but stays intact throughout the middle of the pan due to the moisture from the sauce and the chicken. If you’re unsure, you can use aluminum foil.</p>

            <div class="step-card">
                <p>The sauce has a lot of salt, but only half of it is used. If worried, start with 1 teaspoon in the sauce and add extra salt to taste during or after baking.</p>

                <p>I like this yellow rice, and it would be delicious with homemade green rice! For beans, I like refried beans or ready-to-serve black beans.</p>
